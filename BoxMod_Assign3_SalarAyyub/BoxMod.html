    <h2 class="heading-1">Greetings from Khyber!</h2>

    <p class="box-1">
        Good Evening! My name is Salar Ayyub and I am from Pakistan! 
        Today in this blog, I will be sharing with you my experience 
        of my recent tour of Pakistan's frontier province and home
        to one of Pakistan's famous landmarks Khyber Pass, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa!
        I started on a windy, overcast morning from Islamabad, catching the Peshawar bound coach.
        Passing the lush green country side of Punjab province, we found ourselves at the Expressway.
        An hour after noon, we entered Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province and behold! There it was, 
        the lush land of our ancestors, land of brave men, full of patriots. Land of Ghaznavi and Durrani and 
        the Victors of Baltistan, valiant men, the Pashtuns, Hindkowans and Waziris, 
        a nation devoted to God and Pakistan.   
    </p>

    <p class="box-2">
        Passing through the expressway, on either side lay acres of fragrant orchards, 
        of peaches, apples and oranges, orbs shining like pearls in the Spring sunshine, 
        numerous for the eyes to behold yet the soul cherished. Birds chirping and dancing, 
        these orchards are their abode and everyday is Novroz in this land.
        Crossing the bridge, underneath flowed the Kabul River, its water glistening like the stars in our sky. 
        What is Nile and Euphrates, when Kabul flows through you? On its banks, Pashtun rural women, 
        valiant, pious and alluring, wrapped in Dhussa shawls, carry water pitchers on their waists. Villages full of life,
        as if this was a land carved off Heaven, the air of sweet scent that swept across, brought joy and comfort
        to its dwellers. Truly, abundance is made common in this land.      
    </p>

    <p class="box-3">
        Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is the heart of Pakistan and Kabul River its artery. 
        Dotted in the everlasting meadows, that meet the giant mountains, lay numerous villages more 
        that eventually lead to Peshawar, the grand city, the provinical capital and home. Our home. 
        We have arrived. 
    </p>

    <h5 class="date-2">MARCH 21 2021</h5>
    <h2 class="heading-2">Weekend in Peshawar</h2>
    
    <p class="box-4">
        It is an extremely pleasant weather here in Peshawar. Forecast is of heavy downpour 
        for the next couple of days. This city amazes in numerous ways! A stark contrast, where new meets 
        the old and antique. The Old City experience is a step back in time. Men in traditional kurtas and
        turbans, women in burqas, the narrow streets bustle with energy and most importantly, 
        aroma of a hundred, delicious dishes. Streets lined with bar-b-ques, beef brain and liver sauted 
        in herbs and spices, whole chickens marinated with tandoori spices, shoved in giant ovens, naan breads
        pulled out hot and fresh from earthen ovens. One of the dishes that is a must in every Pashtun dinner,
        is Chapli Kebab; beef patty made of tomato, beef bone marrow and chillies, deep fried
        in pure butter in a huge jacuzzi like pan, later garnished with oregano. A bite of this kebab melts 
        in your mouth and the marrow nuggets explode with flavour and buttery richness.   
    </p>
    
    <p class="box-5">
        Also
        the lamb kebabs! Each nugget in a lamb kebab skewer is covered with a thin layer of lamb fat. Well 
        seasoned with spices, the juicy explosion later on is something to die for. 
        But the people are the highlight and this is the city of hospitality. Even in my own city,
        which I have visited after 10 years (I live in Dhaka, Bangladesh currently), have I been 
        the fortunate victim of Pashtun hospitality. Where ever I go and whatever I purchase, the vendors
        shake hands with me, say Salam and would not accept payment, out of respect. There was a vendor 
        beside a kebab joint where we were dining in, who by himself brought me a mug 
        of banana smoothie. I did not order it but he came to know and as a common courtesy, 
        he brought me a mug and would not accept payment. "A token of love" he said.
    </p>
    
    <p class="box-6">
        Qehva, green tea with cardamom, is a must after every meal. What a drink! Now I am addicted to it. 
        As I write this, I will be travelling back to Islamabad tomorrow and I already know, 
        this realization has crept inside me, that I will be dearly missing Peshawar and the people. 
    </p>

    <p class="box-7">
        Until next time, bye Peshawar!
    </p>

    <p class="box-8">
        I may not live in Peshawar but Peshawar lives in my heart always!
    </p>
