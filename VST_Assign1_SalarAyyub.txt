    <h2>About HTML</h2>
        Hypertext Markup Language, otherwise known as HTML, is the standard markup language used 
        for designing web pages.
        It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS and Javascript.
        <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and renders them 
            into multimedia webpages. 
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally includes 
            cues for the appearance of the documents. 
        </p>

    <h2>About CSS</h2>
        Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
        of a document within a markup language such as HTML. 
        Alongside HTML and Javascript, CSS is a cornerstone of the World Wide Web.
        <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and contents such 
            as fonts, colours etc. 
            This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
            and control in the presentation characteristics,
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
            by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file 
            which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content 
            as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve
             the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.  
        </p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. 
    It is designed for creating network-centric applications. 
    It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement 
    because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
